# morningRoutine
This project uses Raspberry Pis to automate a basic morning routine.
The basic components are an alarm clock, an automatic shower and an automatic coffee maker.
The alarm clock will not go off until a motion sensor detects movement, and the 
other components are turned on relative to the time of the alarm.

This project is being coded in python
